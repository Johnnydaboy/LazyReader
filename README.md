# LazyReader
Ever wanted to make a book easier to read? Well with lazy reader, now you can!

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).

## Purpose of the Software
This LazyReader program classifies words in the English vocabulary based on the frequency of the word used in everyday life based on the NGLS database. It features several libraries: MIT JWI, OpenNLP, WordNet, and Apache to retrieve and replace synonyms of nouns based on the input level of "difficulty" by the user in the given sentence.
