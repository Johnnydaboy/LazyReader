  During this project we learned how to use Java libraries, the process of importing and applying the usage of specific libraries to our program such as using WordNet to look up synonyms for a specific word. We also learned how to use GitHub with other people especially pulling and pushing projects and this can be applied to many future projects while working remotely and independently. We enjoyed being able to collaborate with our partners and actually create our own program that can be used by other people for a useful purpose. It was also a good learning experience using the different libraries so that we can apply this experience to future projects and know what to do when we run into issues. One of the most frustrating/challenging part in the project was identifying certain parts of speech such as verbs and applying the correct verb tense as the replacement. While most sentences become easier/more difficult based on the chosen difficulty level and can be understood, some sentences that were formed sometimes become a little confusing as the context of other words in the sentences are changed with the replacement of the nouns with synonyms. To address that issue, we would need a larger database with context identifiers to replace the correct words and keep the meaning of the sentence the same. We really found the documentations of the libraries very helpful as we could reference those and help set up and get them working with our program, as well as the online tutorials on how to set them up.
